# Branch source Aged Refs

This is a collection of extensions for several branch source Jenkins plugins.

It provides filters for

- [Bitbucket]: Filtering references (branches and pull requests)
- [GitHub]: Filtering references (branches and pull requests)

This filter will ignore references (branches and pull requests) where its last
commit creation date is older than the defined threshold (in days). Ignored
references won't be added as sources or will be disabled and tagged for
deletion on the next full repository scan.

[Bitbucket]: https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source/
[GitHub]: https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/

## Usage

When defining a new job (or Organization folder), include an additional
behaviour (placed under the additional separator).Â

This behaviour is configurable, being mandatory to specify the
acceptable threshold (positive days) for each reference:

In case of an invalid positive threshold, the form won't validate:
